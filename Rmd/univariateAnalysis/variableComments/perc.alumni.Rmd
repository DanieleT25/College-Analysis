The **perc.alumni** variable was modeled with the **Beta-original (BEo)** distribution.

Although the KDE and fitted distribution show some alignment, diagnostic checks reveal important issues:

* quantile residuals exhibit kurtosis;
* the **Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test** (D = 0.26808, p-value = 0.0002684) rejects the null hypothesis.

Thus, the BEo distribution provides only a partial description of the data.
