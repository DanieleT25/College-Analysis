The **P.Undergrad** variable is extremely **concentrated near zero** and highly **right-skewed** with large outliers.

The selected model is the **Box-Cox Power Exponential-original (BCPEo)**. All parameters $\theta = (\hat\mu, \hat\sigma, \hat\nu, \hat\tau)$ are significant.

However, diagnostic checks reveal problems:

* the **residual density** is asymmetric;
* the **Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test** (D = 0.14887, p-value = 2.545e-11) rejects the null hypothesis.

Thus, despite parameter significance, the **BCPEo distribution does not provide an adequate fit**.
