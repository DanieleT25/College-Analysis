The **Personal** variable is **right-skewed** with **outliers**.

The **Lognormal (LOGNO)** distribution was tested but performed poorly:

* residual diagnostics deviate from normality;
* the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test confirms lack of fit.

Thus, the **LOGNO model is not adequate for this variable**.
