The **Top10perc** variable is highly **right-skewed**, with some **outliers above 65%**.

The fitted distribution is the **Generalized Beta type 1 (GB1)**. Most parameters are significant, with the exception of
$\hat\mu$.

Diagnostic checks highlight several issues:

* the worm plot shows points outside the 95% confidence bands;
* the residual density is asymmetric;
* the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test (D = 0.33988, p-value = 5.886e-09) rejects the null hypothesis.

Hence, the **GB1 model does not adequately capture the distribution of this variable**.
