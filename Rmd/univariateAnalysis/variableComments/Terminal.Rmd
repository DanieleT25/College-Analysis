The **Terminal** variable was modeled with the **Beta (BE)** distribution.

Although the parameter estimates are reasonable, **residual** diagnostics show values **outside the 95% confidence interval** and the **Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test rejects the null hypothesis**.

Hence, the **BE model is not a suitable fit**.
