The **Grad.Rate** variable is slightly **left-skewed**.

The **Generalized beta type 1 (GB1)** distribution provides a reasonable graphical fit, with residuals showing no major problems.

However, the **Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test** (D = 0.19321, p-value = 0.004664) rejects the null hypothesis, suggesting that the GB1 model does not fully capture the distribution.
