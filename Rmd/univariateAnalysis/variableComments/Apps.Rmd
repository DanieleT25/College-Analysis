The **Apps** variable shows a highly **right-skewed** distribution with several **high-value outliers**. The boxplot reveals that most institutions received a relatively low number of applications, while some colleges stand out with exceptionally high values, in some cases exceeding 20,000, with one extreme case near 50,000.

The histogram with KDE estimation highlights the strong concentration in the lower range and the presence of a long right tail. The distribution fitted using the **Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GIG)** model provides a good approximation, capturing both the skewness and the general shape of the distribution.

The estimates of **$\hat\mu$ and $\hat\sigma$ are more significant**, with values of about 8 and 0.32. The **$\hat\nu$** is slightly less significant than others parameters, with a value of about -0.31.

The residual diagnostic plots suggest an adequate fit:

* the Q-Q plot indicates **a good alignment of the residuals with the theoretical normal distribution**, with only minor deviations in the tails;
* the residual density is approximately **symmetric** and **centered** around zero.

The worm plot supports these findings: **most points lie within the confidence bands**, with only mild systematic deviations in the tails. This indicates that the GIG model provides a satisfactory description of the data, although it may not perfectly capture the most extreme cases.

Finally, the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test (D = 0.0315, p-value = 0.4803) **fails to reject the null hypothesis**, further confirming the goodness of fit. Overall, the GIG distribution represents an appropriate choice to model the Applications variable.
