The behavior of the variable **Books** is unusual. The variable also shows a **right-skewed** distribution with several **high- and low-value outliers**. The KDE exhibits **overfitting**, which occurs when the smoothing parameter is too small.

The fitDist function in GAMLSS does not work well in this case, so a mixture of two Gamma distributions was applied.
